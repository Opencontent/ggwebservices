Changes from 0.13 to 0.14 - released 2013/xx/yy

*Added:

- make the webservices/execute view respect ValidateClientIPs even when server
  is behind a reverse proxy (needs eZP 4.5 or later and config in site.ini)

* Changed

- all the response classes now save http headers in $this->headers() when decoding
  a payload. This makes it easier to execute further processing, eg. support custom
  authentication schemes

*Bugfixes:

- avoid strict errors with eZP5 LS
