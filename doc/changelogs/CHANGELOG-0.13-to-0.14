Changes from 0.13 to 0.14 - released 2013/xx/yy

*Added:

- make the webservices/execute view respect ValidateClientIPs even when server
  is behind a reverse proxy (needs eZP 4.5 or later and config in site.ini)

- debugger always displays status code, charset, content-type for all execute calls (REST first!)

* Changed

- all the response classes now save http headers in $this->headers() when decoding
  a payload. This makes it easier to execute further processing, eg. support custom
  authentication schemes

- it is possible that, when servers do not specify it, the charset of a response now defaults to empty whereas it defaulted to UTF-8 before

- REST requests will happily receive a plaintext or html reponse without trying to decode it.
  This makes it easier to use them for interacting with sites (posting to forms etc)

*Bugfixes:

- avoid strict errors with eZP5 LS

- make the debugger work correctly when testing the current server by using the
  admin siteaccess and plain php session handler
 
- all types of responses properly set their content-type, status code and charset on decoding
