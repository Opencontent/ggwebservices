GG Webservices extension for eZ Publish
========================================

An extension that adds/improves the native capabilities of eZ Publish to work as
- webservices server
- webservices client
with a visual webservices debugger thrown in for good measure


Goals
-----
Allow to easily execute calls to remote servers using JSONRPC, XMLRPC and SOAP
protocols or REST schemes (both from within php code and templates)

Allow to expose existing functionality as JSONRPC or XMLRPC, REST (and eventually
better SOAP) webservices, much as it can already be done with SOAP and eZJSCore
in any eZ Publish installation

Allow to expose functionality as webservice regardless of the protocol used by
the client - without having to duplicate code

Provide a proxy module allowing javascript code served by an eZ Publish server
to execute cross-domain webservice calls (without resorting to html tricks) and
even cross-protocol calls

Allow easy debugging of webservice calls via inclusion of a complete debugging
interface

Improve support for WSDL in SOAP calls (both server-side and client-side)

Improve the existing http client adding features such as support for more
authentication schemes, compressed requests etc...

Allow usage of JSONRPC or XMLRPC (and eventually SOAP) to call functions exposed
via the ezjscore extension API

Keep the same API as the existing eZP SOAP classes for maximum interoperability

Long term, the existing SOAP client and server could be replaced with a new one,
based either on PHP::SOAP or NuSOAP


Prerequisites
-------------
- PHP 5 / eZP 4.0+
- to execute/receive jsonrpc calls, the php JSON extension is needed
- to execute/receive rest calls, the php SIMPLEXML or JSON extensions are needed
- to execute/receive xmlrpc calls, the php XMLRPC extension is needed
- to call remote services using wsdl descriptions the php SOAP extension is needed
- to integrate with the ezjscore extension, eZP 4.2 is needed (and the ezjscore
  extension too, of course)


Basics
------
Server (eZPublish exposes webservices):
- to receive xmlrpc, jsonrpc or 'rest' calls, you need to:
  1. modify the configuration in ``wsproviders.ini`` and possibly in ``site.ini.append.php``
  2. create a file ``extension/<xxx>/<jsonrpc|xmlrpc|rest>/initialize.php`` with the
     php code to be exposed as webservice

Client (eZPublish accesses webservices exposed by other systems):
- every remote webservice server that has to be accessed from the eZ Publish
  server itself has to be defined in ``wsproviders.ini``
- to call remote webservices from within templates use the template fetch function
  ``fetch( 'webservices', 'call', hash( paramname, value, ... ) )``
  Please remember to desactivate the view cache where needed for node templates
  that execute webservice calls
- to call remote webservices from php code use
  ``ggeZWebServicesClient::call( $server, $metod, $params=array(), $options=array() );``

For more details on usage of the extension, look in the doc/ directory.


Known limitations
-----------------
- support for WSDL is limited
- jsonrpc support is only available for version 1.0, not for 2.0
- the ws client does not support automatic cookie management
- the ws client does not support oauth authentication
- the proxy view works exposing an xmlrpc+jsonrpc api. This means that it can not
  be used to emulate the richer semantics of soap/rest calls. E.g. at the moment
  it can not be used to send POST calls to rest webservices
- rest support is far from perfect, as the extension was developed based on rpc
  semantics (call a *method* which takes a *hash of parameters*).
  Currently:
  + for the rest client, the parameters will be translated into query
    string or http request payload, not into a slash-separated part of the url.
  + for the rest server, there is no support for having slash-separated
    parameters or complex routing rules
- and much more: read doc/todo to get a detailed list of bits which could improve


FAQ
---
  Q: how do I debug webservices without going insane?
  A1: you're a lucky guy, since this extension provides a nice graphical debugger
      within the standard admin interface
  A2: when DebugSettings/DebugOutput and TemplateSettings/DevelopmentMode are
      both enabled, the requests sent by the fetch function webservices/call
      will be displayed as part of the standard debug output
  A3: by enabling logging, you n00b!
      There is an ini setting in wsproviders.ini that controls verbosity for a
      log file dedicated to webservices: var/<vardir>/log/webservices.log
